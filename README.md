# Virus Transmission

Virus spread can not only cause serious health issues, but also overload health systems.  
In [this project](https://github.com/luizmanke/virus-transmission/blob/master/main.ipynb) we will take a look at a virus transmission in a population.  
Our goal is to look for insights that can help us to take better actions to prevent the fast spread of the virus.
